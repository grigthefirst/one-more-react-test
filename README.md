# airfocus coding test

Welcome to the airfocus coding test! Happy that you want to take our test. The procedure is very simple:

* You will find one ore more folders in the root of this repository. Every folder is a task.
* Inside the task folder you will find a dedicated `README.md` with information about what to do.
* Under [Actions](../../actions) you will also find a CI job. Make sure that the tests are green.
* Once done create a single pull request against `master` that contains the solutions for all tasks.

Looking forward to your solutions!
